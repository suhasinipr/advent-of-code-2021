A place to put all my  experiments solving advent of code 2021

I am learning a new language - dart!
And this is my way of learning it. 


Most often, you will find that these answers are not the most optimal way of solving a puzzle. 
But that is because my intention is to learn the nuances of the language, more than focussing on the algo :)
